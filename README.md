# l05c03_flowers_with_data_augmentation
This code is my solution to the l05c03 exercice.    
l05c03: Chapter05, Lesson03 of the Intro to Tensorflow for Deep Learning, on Udacity.      
The goal of the exercice was to use Data Augmentation and other techniques such as Dropout to avoid overfitting in a CNN.                 
The CNN created aims to classify flower images in 5 classes :['roses', 'daisy', 'dandelion', 'sunflowers', 'tulips']
